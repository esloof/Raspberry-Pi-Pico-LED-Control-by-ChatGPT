# Raspberry-Pi-Pico-LED-Control-by-ChatGPT
The Pico W has a Wi-Fi adapter, which can be used to host a webpage. It also has an onboard led, which can be switched on and off. It would be great if I could toggle the led via a webpage. Think about the possibilities, like garage door openers or anything you want to control remotely.
